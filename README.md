# Anomaly-Detection-Autoencoders
I will train an autoencoder to detect anomalies on a dataset that contains 5,000 Electrocardiograms, each with 140 data points. I will use a simplified version of the dataset, where each example has been labeled either 0 (corresponding to an abnormal rhythm), or 1 (corresponding to a normal rhythm). I'm interested in identifying the abnormal rhythms.

This is a labeled dataset, so one could phrase this as a supervised learning project. The goal of this project is to illustrate anomaly detection concepts I can apply to larger datasets, where I do not have labels available (for example, if I had many thousands of normal rhythms, and only a small number of abnormal rhythms). An autoencoder is trained to minimize reconstruction error. I will train an autoencoder on the normal rhythms only, then use it to reconstruct all the data. The hypothesis is that the abnormal rhythms will have higher reconstruction error. I will then classify a rhythm as an anomaly if the reconstruction error surpasses a fixed threshold.
